## What is IDE Embedded?

**IDE Embedded** is a high-performance, native desktop platform for modeling, simulating, and generating code for event-driven embedded systems.

Stop wrestling with low-level boilerplate, debounce logic, and hardcoded state machines. Model your hardware workspace visually, design robust logic with an intuitive block-based engine, and compile high-quality C++ code in seconds.

```text
Visual Workspace (Components + Blocks) → IDE Embedded → Production C++ Code (.ino)
```

Designed for speed, visual excellence, and a premium developer experience.

## Pioneering Architecture
**IDE Embedded** is powered by a groundbreaking, event-oriented programming model for embedded components pioneered by **Herick B. Tiburski**. This methodology abstracts raw physical hardware signals and interrupts into clean, component-level logical events, establishing a pioneering paradigm shift in how embedded software is visually designed and modeled.

## How it Works

IDE Embedded separates raw physical hardware signals from your core business logic using the **Event Sandwich** architecture:

```text
                     Hardware Workspace (ESP32)
                                │
                                ▼
         Physical Monitor (Automatic Debouncing & Hysteresis)
                                │
                                ▼
         User Event Logic (High-Level Block functions)
```

1. **Hardware Monitors** directly track state, manage debouncing, and handle noise isolation in the background.
2. **User Logic Functions** are triggered only when clean, confirmed events occur.
3. The **Main Loop** remains ultra-lean, acting strictly as a scheduler to keep timing-critical systems highly responsive.

## Features

*   **Visual Block Editor** — Premium, drag-and-drop Sketchware-inspired interface. Create math expressions, loops, serial formatting, and manage persistent memory visually.
*   **Custom Component Creator** — Design and define complex custom hardware parts with dedicated properties, pins, simulation behaviors, and semantic roles.
*   **Automatic Pin Tracing & Routing** — Automatically maps GPIO signals and validates GND/VCC rail connectivity even when chained through complex passive networks (resistors, switches, tracks).
*   **EEPROM State Persist Engine** — High-level persistent saving and restoring blocks that handle low-level memory offset management and C++ EEPROM commitments transparently.
*   **Live Simulation Canvas** — Interactive QGraphicsView workspace displaying active motor rotations, buzzer audio ripples, glowing LEDs, and analog sensor readings in real-time.
*   **Zero Boilerplate Generation** — Generates complete, compile-ready, and human-readable Arduino/ESP32 C++ sketches instantly.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Core Architecture** | C++17 |
| **UI & Graphics** | Qt6 (QtWidgets, QtGui, QtCore), QGraphicsScene, QGraphicsView |
| **Build System** | CMake, Ninja compiler |
| **Serialization** | Qt JSON Library (QJsonDocument, QJsonObject, QJsonArray) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a fully functional C++ compiler supporting C++17 (e.g. GCC/MinGW) and the Qt6 SDK.

### Build and Launch (Windows)

```powershell
# Set compiler paths (e.g. MSYS2 MinGW-w64)
$env:PATH = 'C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;' + $env:PATH

# Configure the build files
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja

# Compile the target executable
cmake --build build

# Launch the executable
./build/apps/ide/ide-embedded.exe
```
---

## Build Automation, Commit, and Version Restoring

To prevent any loss of progress, the IDE features an automated compilation, backup, and version-control system powered by Git.

### 1. Build, Auto-Commit, and Push
Whenever you want to build the project and securely push your changes to GitHub, run the `compilar.bat` script located in the root of the project:

```powershell
# Compiles the project and pushes an incremental backup to GitHub
.\compilar.bat
```

This script:
1. Rebuilds the IDE with maximum release optimizations (`-O3` and Link-Time Optimization).
2. Detects modifications in your codebase if the compilation is 100% successful.
3. Automatically generates an incremental version tag titled **`ID:<number>`** (e.g., `ID:1`, `ID:2`, `ID:3`...).
4. Pushes the commit directly to your remote repository on GitHub.

### 2. How to Restore an Older Version
If you ever want to revert or examine a previous version (e.g., go back to `ID:2` or `ID:1`), you don't need to remember complex commit hashes! Simply use Git's text-matching feature:

```powershell
# Rollback the workspace state to version ID:2
git checkout ":/ID:2"

# Rollback the workspace state to version ID:1
git checkout ":/ID:1"
```

*   **To return to the latest code (continue developing)**:
    ```powershell
    git checkout main
    ```
